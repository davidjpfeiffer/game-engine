## Game Engine

This project allows players to write C++ algorithms to play games such as Tic Tac Toe and Connect Four. Abstractions are defined in the form of abstract base classes for common game objects like players, game states, and game definitions. These abstractions are meant to be applicable to any two-player, turn-based, strategy game and therefore any game that meets these requirements should be able to be played using this game engine.

This project was originally written by David J Pfeiffer for the 2016 Southeast Missouri State Hackathon. The project has since been completely rewritten and more games, players, and features have been added.

### How It Works

The game and players are determined at runtime via CLI inputs.
